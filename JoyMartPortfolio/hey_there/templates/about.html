    <p>I am a junior software developer who is trained in the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Python.
        I have applied these languages in Bootstrap, Django, NodeJS, React JS, jQuery, mySQL, and SQlite.
    <br>
    <br>My passion is to bring order to chaos.
    <br>I especially loved working with Django and am excited to continue educating myself by learning new libraries and frameworks.
        I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com" target="_blank">The Tech Academy</a>â€™s Python Boot
        Camp where I worked on a live project. You can see it <a href="https://github.com/JoyMart" target="_blank">here</a>.
